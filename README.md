# campaign-manager
The Campaign Manager is an autonomous observing mode that I developed for the University of North Carolina's [Skynet's New Observing Mode: The Campaign Manager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.0).

The Campaign Manager code is not hosted here. This repo is meant to serve as a place to host public information regarding the Campaign Manager. Please view the wiki for all available information. Additionally, feel free to read the systemes paper: [Skynet's New Observing Mode: The Campaign Manager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08613).
